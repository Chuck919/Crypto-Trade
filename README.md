# Crypto-Trade
## Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor. I am just a guy who likes to code and learn about crypto.

There exists many different crypto trading platforms out there, however, I wanted to experiment with my own trading bots. Hence, Crypto Trade. Currently, this project only supports Binance.US (becaues Binance is one of the most popular exchanges for crypto bots), but in the future, I hope to add in more exchanges. This project is also made to be ran on pythonanywhere, so a lot of functionality (websockets, rabbitMQ, celery, threading, etc.) are not implemented into the project.

Also more information can also be found on [My Website](http://changwen919.eu.pythonanywhere.com/crypto_trade).
